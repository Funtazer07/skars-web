        <h1>WHO AM I?</h1>
        <p>Name's Vassil.</p>
        <p>Bulgarian-born, currently based in the Netherlands ‚Äî event photographer and videographer, running on thrive and a shit-ton of coffee. I'm the idiot who'll constantly run around in the crowd, dance, and vibe with them ‚Äî so that the actual vibe gets captured.</p>
        <p>The one thing I actually care about is: making sure you look at your photos and say, "That's exactly how it felt."</p>

        <h1>HOW THE FUCK DID THAT HAPPEN?</h1>
        <p>I actually started in cybersecurity ‚Äî clocked in, tapped away at a keyboard thinking I was doing the "smart" thing. You know‚Ä¶ good salary, good future, and all that kind of shit. Then out of nowhere, a friend asked if I could take some prom photos. I had a camera. I liked shooting stuff for fun. So I said yes. That day turned my life upside down. Watching the mom of the graduate tear up at the end of the event ‚Äî that feeling hit different. And suddenly I was thinking:</p>
        <p>"Wait, what if this could be my actual job, instead of telling people to change their fucking password?"</p>
        <p>So I quit. No backup plan. Just the gut feeling that I'd rather mess it all up doing something I care about than stay safe doing something I hate. You know‚Ä¶ the usual story. Now I'm doing my dream job.</p>

        <h1>WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM ME?</h1>
        <p>I'm a social person. That means I'll always vibe with the crowd ‚Äî which I personally believe is the most important thing when it comes to capturing proper marketing materials.</p>
        <p>I also make sure to take great care of my clients, so touch-ups and re-edits? Not a problem. Since I don't like talking too much about myself, here are some reviews I've gotten from my clients:</p>

            <p class="review-text">"We have worked with Vassil from Skars Photography a couple of times now and each time it is an absolute pleasure, both for live band/event photography as well as modelling situations. Vassil is a true professional to the bone, always committed to get the best results possible, no matter the challenges at hand.
              He goes the extra mile both while taking the pictures and editing them. This shows in the final results, which are a blend of creativity, skill, talent, enthusiasm and cooperation with both the environment and client.
              His communication is honest and clear, so that you always know what to expect.
              On top of it all, Vassil is a fantastic guy, as kind and humble as they come and full of energy. We would absolutely recommend everyone working with Skars Photography, since there simply is no one better in our opinion."</p>
